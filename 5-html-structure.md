+ Then assign tasks to the user personas

## What information do your users need?

+ Prioritize info from key points down to non-essential or background info

### Questions to help decide on what info to provide:
+ Are users familier with subject area/brand/product/service or need intro?

# Site Maps
Use **card sorting** to create site maps
+ ask target audience to help you group related info together
+ remember to focus on the goals of the users - what they're wanting to achieve

# Wireframes
+ focuses on function, not design
+ helpful to start here with client so not distracted by how the site looks
+ should show how you've prioritized the information
+ can use Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign
+ insert wireframe image here

# Visual Design = Communication
Communication = organizing and prioritizing information/content
+ **Visual hierarchy** - where attention is drawn - created by adding **visual contrast**
  + Size, color, style
  + Images
+ Grouping & Similarity
  + Headers help with screen readers

## Designing Navigation
+ No more than eight links at primary nav - one word each - sections of site, not ancillary like logins, search, legal etc.
