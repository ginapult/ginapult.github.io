##**Growth Mindset Explained**

Growth mindset is understanding that no matter what, with effort, it's possible to learn and grow. The other type of mindset is "fixed" in that you think you are only as good as your natural talents and cannot learn or grow beyond them.

##**3 Reminders for keeping a growth mindset:**
1. I will remeber that mistakes prove I am are putting in effort. What effort is helpful next?
2. Anytime I think to myself, "I have no idea what I'm doing" I will add "...YET!"
> "I have no idea what I'm doing...YET!"
3. When things are challenging/hard, I will tell myself 
> "This is meant to be hard. I am growing by challenging myself."
