# What I learned about Growth Mindset

## Growth Mindset in My Words

*Growth mindset* is understanding that **no matter what, with effort, it's possible to learn and grow.** The other type of mindset is "fixed" in that you think you are only as good as your natural talents and cannot learn or grow beyond them.

## 3 Reminders for me to keep a growth mindset:

* I will remember that mistakes prove I am are putting in effort and ask myself:
> "What effort is helpful next?"

* Anytime I think to myself, "I have no idea what I'm doing" I will add "...YET!"
> "I have no idea what I'm doing...YET!"

* When things are challenging/hard, I will remind myself:
> "This is meant to be hard. I am growing by challenging myself."
