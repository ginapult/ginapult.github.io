# What I learned about Growth Mindset

*Growth mindset* is understanding that **no matter what, with effort, it's possible to learn and grow.** The other type of mindset is "fixed" in that you think you are only as good as your natural talents and cannot learn or grow beyond them.

## 3 Reminders for me to keep a growth mindset:

* I will remember that mistakes prove I am are putting in effort and ask myself:
> "What effort is helpful next?"

* Anytime I think to myself, "I have no idea what I'm doing" I will add "...YET!"
> "I have no idea what I'm doing...YET!"

* When things are challenging/hard, I will remind myself:
> "This is meant to be hard. I am growing by challenging myself."

## Fixed vs Growth Mindset

When you want to tell yourself... | Remember that...
------------ | -------------
~~I'm not good at this.~~ | No one is good at it when just beginning.
~~I give up.~~ | Trying a new strategy will give me a way forward.
~~This is too hard.~~ | It's meant to be hard. We grow by challenging ourselves.
~~I made a mistake.~~ | Mistakes prove I'm putting in the effort. What effort is helpful next?
~~I'll never be that smart.~~ | Being smart is something you learn. You aren't done getting smarter.
~~It's not easy... I can't figure it out... I don't know...~~ | ...yet

>"A few modern philosophers assert that an individual's intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement and literally to become more intelligent than we were before." - Alfred Binet, Inventor of the IQ Test
