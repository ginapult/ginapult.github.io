# What I learned about Growth Mindset

## Growth Mindset in My Words

Growth mindset is understanding that no matter what, with effort, it's possible to learn and grow. The other type of mindset is "fixed" in that you think you are only as good as your natural talents and cannot learn or grow beyond them.

## 3 Reminders for me to keep a growth mindset:

1. I will remember that mistakes prove I am are putting in effort and ask myself:
> "What effort is helpful next?"

2. Anytime I think to myself, "I have no idea what I'm doing" I will add "...YET!"
> "I have no idea what I'm doing...YET!"

3. When things are challenging/hard, I will remind myself:
> "This is meant to be hard. I am growing by challenging myself."
