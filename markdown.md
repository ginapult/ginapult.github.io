**What I learned about markdown:**
* Markdown is a way to style text on the web and it can be used in most places on GitHub
* Markdown is mostly just regular text with a few non-alpha characters thrown in.
  * For example, ```**This is Bold**```="**This is Bold**"
* I can also use it to embed images.
  * For example, I used this ```![Image of Rainbow](http://howitworks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/double-rainbow-wide-wallpaper-339755.jpg)``` to embed this image below:![Image of Rainbow](http://howitworks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/double-rainbow-wide-wallpaper-339755.jpg)
* I can have up to six different types/sizes of headers using "#"
  * For example:
    * ```# Header 1``` =
    # Header 1        
    * ```## Header 2``` = 
    ## Header 2
    * ```### Header3``` = 
    ### Header 3
    * ```#### Header4``` = 
    #### Header 4
    * ```##### Header 5``` = 
    ###### Header 5
    * ```###### Header 6``` = 
    ###### Header 6
* I can also add emojis
  * For example ```:heart_eyes:``` will embed the :heart_eyes: emoji! :punch: (```:punch:```)
