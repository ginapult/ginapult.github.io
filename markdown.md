**What I learned about markdown:**
* Markdown is a way to style text on the web and it can be used in most places on GitHub
* Markdown is mostly just regular text with a few non-alpha characters thrown in.
  * For example, ```**This is Bold**```="**This is Bold**"
* I can also use it to embed images.
  * For example, I used this ```![Image of Rainbow](http://howitworks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/double-rainbow-wide-wallpaper-339755.jpg)``` to embed this image below:![Image of Rainbow](http://howitworks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/double-rainbow-wide-wallpaper-339755.jpg)
