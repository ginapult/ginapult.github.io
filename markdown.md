Read 01: Learning Markdown

# What I learned about markdown:

* Markdown is a way to style text on the web and it can be used in most places on GitHub

* Markdown is mostly just regular text with a few non-alpha characters thrown in.
  * For example, ```**This is Bold**```="**This is Bold**"
  
* I can also use it to embed images.
  * For example, I used this ```![Image of Rainbow](http://howitworks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/double-rainbow-wide-wallpaper-339755.jpg)``` to embed this image below:
  
  ![Image of Rainbow](http://howitworks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/double-rainbow-wide-wallpaper-339755.jpg)
  
  
* I can have up to six different types/sizes of headers using "#"
  * For example:
    * ```# Header 1``` =
    # Header 1        
    * ```## Header 2``` = 
    ## Header 2
    * ```### Header3``` = 
    ### Header 3
    * ```#### Header4``` = 
    #### Header 4
    * ```##### Header 5``` = 
    ###### Header 5
    * ```###### Header 6``` = 
    ###### Header 6
    

* I can also add emojis
  * For example ```:heart_eyes:``` will embed the :heart_eyes: emoji! :punch: (```:punch:```, AKA "fistbump"); I also learned that sometimes the emojis don't translate.


* I can also create checklists
  * For example:
    - [x] this is complete
    - [ ] this is incomplete


* This page has a good explanation of markdown: [markdown explanation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* This section of the page has a list of the markdowns that's useful: [syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax)


**Questions I'm left with today:**
- curious that emojis, spaces between paragraphs, and auto url links don't seem to be working when translating to html
