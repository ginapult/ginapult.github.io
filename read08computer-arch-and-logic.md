## What makes a computer a computer?
+ tool to help solve problems
+ designed to manipulate information
+ thinking machine
+ computers do same four things:
  + INPUT - take input - what the world or you do that makes it do stuff
  + INFORMATION - store information - stored in memory
  + PROCESS - process it - takes it from memory, processes it or manipulates it using algorithms or a series of commands, then sends the processing information back to be stored in memory again
  + OUTPUT - output the results - the processed information is ready to be output; depends on what it's designed to do - text, photos, videos, vr, robot control - output for one computer becomes input for other computers
  - original computers made with wood and metal
  20 century electical components - took 
  started as basic calculators only manipulating numbers

## Binary & Data
+ 1s and 0s and the electical signals that are behind them - they are the backbone of how all computers input, store, process and output information
+ computers work on 1s and 0s - almost noone does work with 1s and 0s 
+ electric wires and currents
+ 1 wire - on or off, yes, no, true, false, 1, 0 - this is called a "bit" smallest bit of info computer can store - more wires, more bits
+ binary number system - decimal (0-9) - binary just 0-1
  + decimal - 1000s, 100s, 10s, 1s
  + binary - 8s, 4s, 2s, 1s - any number represented by 1s and 0s - or wires on or off
    + 32 wires - 0-4 billion
    + videos, images, sound - also can be represented by numbers - pixels - each pixel has a color, represented with numbers
    + sound in binary - series of vibarations in the air - wave form - sound broken into a series of numbers - more bits higher range of numbers

## Circuits & Logic
+ circuitry can be an artform
+ use tech to make the ideas come to life
+ input and output - information - on or off or 1s and 0s
+ millions of teeny exectrobic components to make circuits
+ simple circuit - electric signal on or off - NOT
+ complicated circuits - 2 electical signals - each could be 1 or 0, if either is a 0, will be 0 - this is called AND - if both inputs 1, then 
- more complex circuits
- adder - circut takes in 2 bits - adder circuits
- subtraction and multiplication - 8 bit adder big as a fridge, now they are microscopic in size
- smaller the circuit is, the less it needs to travel

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
- input, store, process, output
- input devices take info from outside and convert it to binary
- store
- process - calculation
- information into output
- How input travels through a computer and becomes output
    - CPU gets instructions from memory to create a "B" - thousands of instructions run for this
    - output device - screen 
    - speaker - sound
    - 3D printer - prints an object - more complicated, more memory computer needs
    - multiple cpu and many gigabytes of memory to store it

## Hardware & Software
- Hardware - look inside computing device - circuits, wires, speakers, plugs, chips, etc.
- Software - computer programs or code running ont hemachine - data science software, games, etc.
- CPU - Central Processing Unit - Master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer - does differentthings - has smaller parts to do tasks - circuite for math and logic, other circuites to send information to different parts ofthe computer - receives simple commands to tell it what circuit to do - add, store (represented in 1s and 0s - binary commands) they are fetched and executed in sequence
- binary code most basic form of software - today software we write looks like python, ruby, blockly - the commands are converted into binary commands that the CPU understands
- software tells CPU what to do
- operating system - the master program that manages how software gets to run on computers - special abilities that lets it control other softward on the computer - the OS is quickly switching between programs - manages software that controls the computers hardware
- coding - what's the problem I want to solve? write program to address this
